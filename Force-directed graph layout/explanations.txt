For scaling, i initially thought to scale it linearly, but the small nodes were way too small and thus hard to double click. So to scale, i took the square root of the weight. However, after doing that, the bigger nodes were not as prominent as i would like. Thus, i multiplied my squared root of the weight by 6 and that gave me a graph that i was proud of and proportions that i want.
